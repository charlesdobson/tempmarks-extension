# To-Do List
This a browser extension to store temporary bookmarks for tabs you're not quite finished with. It is built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows the user to store temporary bookmarks for a period of 1 week, after which they will be removed. 

# Motivation
I often open multiple tabs thinking that I will use them. Every week or so, I clear out my tabs and realize I didn't need them after all. If I store them in the permanent bookmarks folder, they simply provide clutter and rarely get opened. To solve this problem, I decided to create a browser extension to store the URL's temporarily. If I haven't used the bookmark within 1 week, I probably don't need it and it will be removed automatically. 

# Build Status
This extension is currently in the development phase. I'm currently implementing it to work with Chrome but will port it to Firefox once functional. Current work that needs to be completed:
- Get URL and page title from open tabs to populate list
- Make list items open new tab with the URL
- Update colour scheme for a more professional look
- Integrate different timing controls (1 week, 2 weeks, etc)
- Upload to Chrome and Firefox
